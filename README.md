# baryon-spread
A pipeline to track the decoupling of dark and baryonic matter in CAMELS cosmological simulations

There are two ways to run this pipeline. One is through the "Mass comparisons" Jupyter Notebook, which takes the relavant functions from the files here to run the pipeline with the primary goal of tracking the mass originating from different Lagrangian Regions. Alternative, one can run the "Spread Driver" Jupyter notebook to calculate the spread metric (among other relevant quantities) to be saved to a file.
